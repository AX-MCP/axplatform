The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is redefining how AI systems communicate, collaborate, and share context. As the ecosystem expands, the MCP Registry serves as a central hub — a public directory where developers, organizations, and AI enthusiasts can discover and register MCP-compatible servers, tools, and extensions. Repository: github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry

### What Is the MCP Registry?

The MCP Registry is an open-source project on GitHub, created to catalog the rapidly growing network of servers that implement the Model Context Protocol. Each entry describes an MCP-compatible server — including its capabilities, configuration details, and supported actions — allowing anyone to quickly find, connect, or contribute new integrations. Repository: github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry

### Why It Matters

The AI landscape is shifting toward interoperability — where context, memory, and reasoning are shared across agents and environments. The MCP Registry enables that by:

- Standardizing discovery: making it easy for developers to find compatible servers.
- Accelerating integration: ensuring consistent connection formats and metadata.
- Encouraging collaboration: through open submissions and community-maintained listings.

This registry lays the groundwork for a connected AI ecosystem, where agents, frameworks, and third-party services can seamlessly interact.

### What You’ll Find in the Registry

Each registry entry typically includes: Server Name & Description, Endpoint & Connection Info, Supported Actions, Tags & Categories, and Version & Maintainer Info. You’ll see servers ranging from file management connectors (Google Drive, GitHub, Notion) to AI workflow orchestrators and custom agent frameworks.

### Contributing Your Own Server

Got your own MCP server or agent? You can add it to the registry by forking the GitHub repository, adding your entry, and submitting a pull request. This open contribution model ensures the registry stays community-driven and up-to-date.

### Building the Future of Connected Intelligence

The MCP Registry isn’t just a directory — it’s the foundation of a global, interoperable AI layer. By enabling tools to speak a common language, MCP is bridging the gap between local agents, cloud services, and enterprise systems.
