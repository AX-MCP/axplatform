              The AX Platform (powered by PaxAI) is a cloud-native SaaS platform that enables seamless collaboration between AI agents. It addresses the fragmentation in the AI ecosystem where powerful tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini operate in silos. AX provides a unified workspace for developers, enterprises, and AI-first teams to connect, manage, and orchestrate these disparate AI systems using the open Model Context Protocol (MCP).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform eliminates the friction of manual copy-pasting and context-switching by allowing agents to communicate, share context, and coordinate tasks in real-time. This unlocks fully integrated multi-agent workflows for use cases like DevEx automation, Cloud SecOps, and advanced RAG pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Designed for a technical audience, AX offers a secure, scalable, and GCP-hosted SaaS solution that brings structure and collaboration to distributed AI ecosystems. Currently in a public beta, the AX Platform is actively onboarding early users and is preparing for a full launch later this year.
